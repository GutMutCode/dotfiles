;; Place your private configuration here! Remember, you do not need to run 'doom
;; sync' after modifying this file!


;; Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email
;; clients, file templates and snippets. It is optional.

;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom:
;;
;; - `doom-font' -- the primary font to use
;; - `doom-variable-pitch-font' -- a non-monospace font (where applicable)
;; - `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.
;; - `doom-symbol-font' -- for symbols
;; - `doom-serif-font' -- for the `fixed-pitch-serif' face
;;
;; See 'C-h v doom-font' for documentation and more examples of what they
;; accept. For example:
;;
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Maple Mono NF CN" :size 14))
;; (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font" :size 14))
;; (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "FiraCode Nerd Font" :size 14))

;; (set-fontset-font t 'hangul (font-spec :family "Freesentation"))
(set-fontset-font t 'hangul (font-spec :family "S-Core Dream"))
;;
;; If you or Emacs can't find your font, use 'M-x describe-font' to look them
;; up, `M-x eval-region' to execute elisp code, and 'M-x doom/reload-font' to
;; refresh your font settings. If Emacs still can't find your font, it likely
;; wasn't installed correctly. Font issues are rarely Doom issues!

;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:
(setq doom-theme 'doom-tokyo-night)
(setq fancy-splash-image "/Users/xxxx/devs/repos/doom-emacs-splash/svg/doom/doomEmacsTokyoNight.svg")
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(undecorated-round . t))

;; This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
;; numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)

;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
(setq org-directory "~/devs/org/")

(setq org-journal-dir "~/devs/org/journal/")
(defun org-journal-file-header-func (time)
  "Custom function to create journal header."
  (concat
   (pcase org-journal-file-type
     (`daily "#+TITLE: Daily Journal\n#+STARTUP: showeverything")
     (`weekly "#+TITLE: Weekly Journal\n#+STARTUP: folded")
     (`monthly "#+TITLE: Monthly Journal\n#+STARTUP: folded")
     (`yearly "#+TITLE: Yearly Journal\n#+STARTUP: folded"))))

(setq org-journal-file-header 'org-journal-file-header-func)
(setq org-journal-date-format "%A, %d %B %Y")
(setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t)

;; Whenever you reconfigure a package, make sure to wrap your config in an
;; `after!' block, otherwise Doom's defaults may override your settings. E.g.
;;
;;   (after! PACKAGE
;;     (setq x y))
(after! org (set-company-backend! 'org-mode 'company-files 'company-capf))
(after! prog-mode (set-company-backend! 'prog-mode 'company-files 'company-capf 'company-yasnippet))
;;
;; The exceptions to this rule:
;;
;;   - Setting file/directory variables (like `org-directory')
;;   - Setting variables which explicitly tell you to set them before their
;;     package is loaded (see 'C-h v VARIABLE' to look up their documentation).
;;   - Setting doom variables (which start with 'doom-' or '+').
;;
;; Here are some additional functions/macros that will help you configure Doom.
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
;;   this file. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
;;   `require' or `use-package'.
;; - `map!' for binding new keys
;;
;; To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
;; the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
;; This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.
;; Alternatively, use `C-h o' to look up a symbol (functions, variables, faces,
;; etc).
;;
;; You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
;; they are implemented.
